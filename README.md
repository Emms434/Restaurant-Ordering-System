# Restaurant Ordering System

## Overview
This is a self-directed software project that simulates a basic restaurant ordering workflow.  
The goal is to practice programming fundamentals, software design, and object-oriented concepts.

## Features
- Create and modify customer orders
- Process orders and calculate totals
- Modular code structure for scalability and readability

## Technologies
- C++ (or whatever language you used)
- Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Standard libraries for input/output and data handling

## Status
- Work in progress
- Continuously improving structure, readability, and functionality

## Purpose
This project demonstrates my ability to independently design and implement software systems and apply programming concepts to real-world problems.
